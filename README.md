## About The Project


One of the activities you may be asked to do in an interview or during your apprenticeship is to make a Todo List. An often complex part of this type of activity can be saving the information either in a:
- file (*JSON, txt,...*)
- local *database (sqlite, ...)*
- storage *(localstorage, ...)*
- backend *(hosted on a server)*
- etc...


In these repository I propose you the code of a todo list mobile application using a json file as storage medium.

## Built With

In this work we have used mainly two technologies namely:

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Prerequisites

As prerequisite, here we will need to install flutter for this consult the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to see how to install according to the OS you are using. 

### Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ZiyoumaSchool/todo_formation_flutter.git
   ```
2. Install flutter packages
   ```sh

3. Launch program
   ```sh
